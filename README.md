# VisionGuard
* VisionGuard is a desktop application designed to remind users to take eye breaks while working on their computers. 

* The application sends reminders to users every 20 minutes by default, encouraging them to look 20 feet away for 20 seconds â€“ an eye health recommendation often referred to as the 20-20-20 rule.
