# VisionGuard_Windows.Desktop.Application
VisionGuard is a desktop application designed to remind users to take eye breaks while working on their computers. 

The application sends reminders to users every 20 minutes by default, encouraging them to look 20 feet away for 20 seconds â€“ an eye health recommendation often referred to as the 20-20-20 rule.
